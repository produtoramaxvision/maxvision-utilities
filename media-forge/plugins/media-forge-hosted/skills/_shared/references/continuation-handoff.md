# Continuation Handoff

Use this reference for every continue, extend, next-shot, bridge, repair-tail, or re-anchor request. A successor prompt must be based on accepted source footage or an accepted final frame.

## Source Gate

Do not write a continuation prompt until these are known:

- project ID and current clip ID;
- parent clip ID;
- `scene_id`, and whether this continuation stays inside the scene or crosses a scene boundary;
- accepted source clip or accepted final frame;
- observed end state;
- next clip's `felt_intent` - what the viewer should feel or notice;
- completed beats;
- reserved future beats;
- continuity locks;
- exact reference registry;
- active surface or conservative surface profile.

If the source is missing, ask for the clip, final frame, or an exact visible-end description. Do not invent it.

## Observation Fast Path

The user should never be the state sensor **when the agent can actually see**. Attachment and inspection are different things: a host may accept a file and expose only its name. Before filling anything from "what is visible," confirm this client actually renders that media type — see Inspection Honesty in `[ref:agent-compatibility]`. If it does not, this fast path does not apply; take the **inspection unavailable** route below.

When the client does inspect the attachment, the AGENT fills the observation record from what is visible and asks only about what the attachment cannot show:

- **Final frame attached:** the agent reads pose, screen position, wardrobe and props, environment, lighting phase, and framing directly off the still, then asks at most three targeted questions - open motion at the cut, camera movement phase, and audio phase - because a still can never show them.
- **Full clip attached:** the agent reads everything including motion, camera phase, and (when audible) audio phase; usually nothing is left to ask.
- **Nothing attached:** only then fall back to asking the user to describe the visible end - and offer the extraction tool first.
- **Attached but not inspectable:** treat it as if nothing were attached. Say once that this client cannot open the file, ask the user to describe the visible end state, and record what they say as reported rather than seen — set `observation_confidence` to `low`, set `requires_user_confirmation` to `true`, and list the categories you could not verify in `uncertainties`. Never write a description you did not read off the pixels into `observed_end_state` at `medium` or `high` confidence; that is the one move that puts a fabricated state into canon.

media-forge extracts the last frame of a video directly: call the `media_extract_last_frame` MCP tool, or run `media-forge video last-frame <path-to-take.mp4>` on the CLI, pointing it at the previous clip. It requires ffmpeg on PATH (or `MEDIA_FORGE_FFMPEG_PATH` set) — the same requirement every other ffmpeg-backed capability in this codebase has. The extracted frame doubles as the continuation image reference, so one call pays for both the observation record and the next generation's anchor (feed it back in as `firstFrameImage`/`--image` for i2v, or `lastFrameImage`/`--last` for interpolate).

Do not interrogate the user across all record categories when an attachment is present: fill what is visible, state `observation_confidence`, and confirm rather than ask.

## Handoff Record

Record:

- observed start state;
- observed end state;
- open motion vector;
- camera phase;
- screen direction;
- character pose and gaze;
- prop ownership, position, and condition;
- location and persistent environment;
- lighting phase;
- ambience, completed dialogue, active dialogue, music phase, and SFX phase;
- observation confidence and uncertainties.

## Seamless Versus Next Shot

Use `seamless_continuation` only when the next generation continues the same shot, geography, and open motion from accepted footage.

A scene boundary defaults to `intentional_next_shot`: open from canonical references and reset `extension_depth` to 0. Do not promise seamless continuation across a scene boundary.

Use `intentional_next_shot` when an editorial cut is appropriate. It may preserve story continuity, but it does not promise exact frame continuity.

Use `bridge_between_known_states` when a known start state must reach a known final state.

Use `repair_tail` when the final seconds of the parent clip failed.

Use `reanchor_after_drift` when extension depth or visible drift makes the chain unstable.

## Completed And Reserved Beats

Every continuation prompt must exclude completed beats and reserved future beats. If Clip 01 already exited the terminal, Clip 02 must not show the terminal exit again. If vehicle departure is reserved for Clip 03, Clip 02 must stop before departure.

## Exact Reference Tags

Preserve tags byte-for-byte: `@Image1`, `@Image 1`, `@Image1`, `[Video 1]`, and interface equivalents must not be normalized, translated, renumbered, re-cased, or reformatted.

## Acceptance Rule

Accepted observed state overrides planned state. Rejected footage never becomes canon. Future prompts stay provisional until the previous accepted take is reviewed.
